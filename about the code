We used webscrapping for this project
We have used Python libraries like beautifulsoup and tkinter
1. Beautifulsoup is a Python library that is used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files.
It creates a parse tree from page source code that can be used to extract data.

2.Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications

Happy Coding!
