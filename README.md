# Price-Comparision-site
In today's time online shopping is more popular than ever, it is convenient and safe.
Price comparison sites and comparison-shopping engines gives ecommerce traders a good opportunity to boost their sales, attract new customers and go ahead against 
their competitors. Even Shoppers often look for best deals and offers for a particular product which they are looking for. It is difficult to visit each and every
website for comparing the deals or a price of a particular product. 
Hence this comparison-shopping site is proposed which will help ecommerce merchants as well as shoppers for collecting product information, including price list, 
from participating retailers and then it displays collective information on a single result page in response to a shopper's or ecommerce merchantâ€™s search query. 
In this way, shoppers can compare prices, and service from multiple retailers on a single page and choose the merchant that offers the best overall value.
Users need to search for a particular product, it will compare the prices from different websites it will also auto correct the product spelling mistake.
This will make easy shopping with best deals as well as ecommerce merchants to know well about their competitors.
